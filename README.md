## ‚ùì Why isn't signal recording working?

1. **Incorrect connections**: Double-check your wiring and connections between the components.
2. **Using M5 Launcher**: Ensure that you're running the CatHack firmware directly, not by using m5launcher.
3. **Missing files on the SD card**: Ensure you've added all required files to the SD card. Refer to the installation guide for details on what should be included.
